### What are the goals?
* to _analyse and do separation of the codes_: separate the codes in order to make the codes clearer, not mixed with unrelated codes that is supposed to be on the file
* to _re-make the project_ : based on the tutorial
* to _do self-test_: to check whether the project runs well as expected 

### Who should do it?
* Students who have had some knowledge on JavaScript

## Tools and Requirements
In this project, we are going to work on HTML, CSS, Javascript, so it is necessary to:
* Undestand Javascript, especially about DOM, Handlers and Listeners, and function. 
* Use Visual Studio Code (any other similar programming tools)
* Gitkraken (optional, you can use any other CLI)

**Requirements** It is suggested to first understand [how JavaScript works](https://javascript.info)

## How do we do it?
The project is simple but it has branches that represents the user stories which are included in the development strategy file. We work per the user story and it contains more branches for each file or smaller unit of works (Handler, Listener, DOM, etc) which each member is assigned to.
