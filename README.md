## Introduction

In this exercise we will have a set of input elements of checkbox type. The user will be allowed to make a single or multiple selection.  
When he wants to make a single selection he can click on the input and once it selected the text will strike through. 
Incase he wants to make multiple selection, first he needs to click the first input as a tart point then he holds the shift key and click another input as the end point by this all the inputs inbetween will be selected and the texts will strike through. This selection should work both directions, top to bottom and bottom to top.
      
### What are the goals?
* to _analyse and do separation of the codes_: separate the codes in order to make the codes clearer, not mixed with unrelated codes that is supposed to be on the file
* to _re-make the project_ : based on the tutorial
* to _do self-test_: to check whether the project runs well as expected 

### Who should do it?
* Students who have had some knowledge on JavaScript

## Tools and Requirements

* Undestand Javascript, especially about DOM, Handlers and Listeners, and function. 
* Use Visual Studio Code (any other similar programming tools)
* Gitkraken (optional, you can use any other CLI)

**Requirements** It is suggested to first understand [how JavaScript works](https://javascript.info)

## How do we do it?
The project is simple but it has branches that represents the user stories which are included in the development strategy file. We work per the user story and it contains more branches for each file or smaller unit of works (Handler, Listener, DOM, etc) which each member is assigned to.
